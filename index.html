          <h2>Bytes from My First Year as a Computer Science Student</h2>

            I completed my first year as a Computer Science student a little
            over two weeks ago, and it was certainly an interesting experience.
            One major takeaway was the importance of making friends and helping
            others. I couldn’t have done it all on my own, especially when
            tackling tough Hackerrank challenges and labs. My friends were
            instrumental in getting through some of the most frustrating errors,
            and I also made new connections along the way. Helping others when I
            could was equally important—you never know when that favor might
            come back around.

            Another important lesson was to study early. I fell victim to
            procrastination, and while it worked out in the first semester, the
            second semester was a completely different story. The stress was
            overwhelming, and although I survived, I realized how much easier it
            could’ve been with better time management. I also learned the hard
            way that staying focused in long lectures and attending tutorials is
            essential. It’s easy to fall behind, but playing catch-up only makes
            things worse. Next year, I'll definitely prioritize staying on top
            of things from the start.(Adapted from my Instagram)

          <h2>Why Computer Science ?</h2>

            When people ask me about my intended field of study, the
            conversation often takes a familiar turn: "What do you want to
            study?" "Medicine?" they reply, shocked when I say, "No, computer
            science or software engineering." Maybe it’s just the norm where I
            live for people to aspire to be doctors, and thankfully, we're
            slowly growing out of that mindset. I initially considered
            engineering in general, but computer science caught my eye after I
            enjoyed subjects like Math, Physics, and Information Technology. A
            visit to a robotics expo piqued my interest in coding, and after
            some shy Googling about careers in this field, I decided to explore
            it further.

            Fast forward to Grade 11, where I was introduced to Pascal in my
            Information Technology class. If you’re starting out, I recommend
            trying EzyPascal to compile your code. Learning coding was
            significant for me because it brought satisfaction after each class,
            my teacher made it engaging, and I finally understood the concepts I
            had seen at the expo. Now, as I navigate my last two years of high
            school studying computer science, I realize I still don’t have a
            definitive answer to why I chose this path. Each day in this
            fascinating field brings me closer to discovering my passion for it,
            and I’m excited for the journey ahead! (Adapted from my Instagram)
